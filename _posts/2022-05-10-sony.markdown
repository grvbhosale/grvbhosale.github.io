- Innovated a Text-to-3D deep learning architecture, transforming text into 3D video game assets.
- Implemented a novel architecture for generating 3D meshes conditioned on text input (Text-to-3D). 
- Extended the SDF-based method with a novel contrastive learning loss to achieve the transformation and generation of chairs based on text tags.
- Achieved comparable qualitative results to state-of-the-art approaches.
